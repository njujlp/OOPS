!> Prepare for an integration of the QG model.

!> At the start of a timestep of the QG model, the state must contain
!! streamfunction, potential vorticity and wind components. The control
!! variable for the analysis, however, contains only streamfunction.
!! This routine calculates potential vorticity and wind from the
!! streamfunction, and is called before an integration of the QG model.
